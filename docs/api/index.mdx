## Accessing the API

All V1 (latest) API endpoints are located at: `https://api.husqy.xyz/v1`. Throughout the documentation you will come across endpoints, make sure this prefix is added before the endpoints.

## Return JSON structure

The structure of the JSON that will be returned by all API endpoints is the same and is as follows:

```
{
  "success": boolean value to display if the request was successfully handled, if so the data key will be filled,
  "data": empty list, list of objects or an object (which may be empty),
  "error": {
      "code": integer with the HTTP status code,
      "message": string with a description of the error and/or HTTP status code,
  },
