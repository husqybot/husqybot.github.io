This section contains information about all Husqy API endpoints. Go to the Husqy API with the next page button or use one of the quick links.

:::warning

- Some endpoint may be described and documented but may not be available for users or API keys to use.
- All requested post data must be present when making a request. On some endpoints, keys may be `None/Null`.
- All endpoints may return `UnauthorizedError` or `ForbiddenError` even though this is not specified.

## API Reference

The Husqy API is organized around REST, it has clear resource-oriented URLS and returns JSON responses. All V1 (latest) API endpoints are located at the following base URL: `https://api.husqy.xyz/v1`. Throughout the documentation you will come across endpoints, make sure this prefix is added before the endpoints.

## Authentication

The Husqy API uses access tokens given by Discord OAuth to authenticate the user and, in combination with known information in the database, to check if a user has access to the server they are interacting with.

### API Keys

Husqy gives server administrators the ability to create API keys which can be used for authentication. API keys have the same level of access as administrators, so be careful when sharing these. More information about API keys can be found [here](https://husqy.xyz/docs/api/api-keys)!

## Errors

The Husqy API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. The most common ranges you will encounter are `2xx` for successful requests and `4xx` for errors in the request. When errors occur (so not in the `2xx` range) Husqy makes use of the ProblemDetail response, f.e.:

```
{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "errors": [],
}
```

:::warning

- Codes in the `5xx` range are possible but most likely indicate in issue in the Husqy API servers.
- Both the `"message"` and `"errors"` keys in the ProblemDetails return are optional and may not be present in all error responses.
