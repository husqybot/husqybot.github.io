Husqy settings are different (default) settings Husqy has when joining a server. These settings are used for making the functionality of Husqy usable for most servers. These settings can be the amount of time before a message is removed or the amount of time before a finished giveaway is deleted. We do however acknowledge that these default values may not be suitable for all servers, bigger server may want a longer save time and smaller servers may not want to use auto kick. To comply with all needs, these settings can be changed using the [Settings dashboard](#additional-information). Administrators of a server can log in and change the settings to the desired values in the settings page (donâ€™t forget to press the Save button to save the changes).

All users can view the current settings using the `/info` command and selecting the `bot info`. Administrators can also use the [Settings dashboard](#additional-information).

## Which settings are there?

Husqy has different settings that can be changed, each setting is used in its own way by Husqy. The settings which can be changed are:

- `Language`: The language in which Husqy will respond;
- `Timezone`: The timezone to use within the server;
- `Unit system`: The unit system of the server;
- `Auto delete`: The time it takes for Husqy to delete its response (for some responses, f.e. big embeds, a base auto delete will be used if the set auto delete time is lower than the - `base time!`);
- `Max warns`: The amount of warnings a user is allowed to get before getting auto kicked (if auto kick is enabled);
- `Auto kick role`: The role Husqy will use to kick a member (if a user is assigned this role the user will be kicked). This role will be assigned by Husqy when the max warns is exceeded - `and auto kick is enabled;
- `Auto kick`: If auto kick is enabled;
- `Invite link`: The invite link to join the server. Members can request this link to invite others;
- `Giveaway save timeout`: The time to save a giveaway before it gets permanently deleted;
