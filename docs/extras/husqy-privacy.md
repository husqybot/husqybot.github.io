Husqy cares a lot about your privacy, thats why the `/privacy` command was created. This command gives you the ability to stop Husqy from using your information for functionality. Using this command can have different consequences (more on that later) to the use of different Husqy services, but does NOT effect any moderation commands, so a server member can’t keep trolling a server without consequences! The `/privacy` command is private and will NEVER be logged. After the first response, the messages are for your eyes ONLY and can’t be seen by other server members!

:::note

Please read our Privacy Policy to get insights in how we handle your data.

:::

:::tip

- Server administrators can view when users have disallowed Husqy from collecting their data and have a shortcut available in the [Privacy Dashboard](#additional-information) to DM that member. This can be used for checking why services may be limited or why configuration may have changed!
- Discord will let you know when only you and Husqy can see the message!

Changes made to the default Privacy settings may result in loss of functionality, please read this page carefully before making changes!

## Changing data collection settings

To change the status of your data collection settings, you must again use the `/privacy` command, select the Data collection option. This will give you a range of new options:

1. `Allow data collection in this server`: To allow data collection by Husqy in the server where the command is triggered;
2. `Disallow data collection in this server`: To disallow data collection by Husqy in the server where the command is triggered;
3. `Allow data collection in all servers`: To allow data collection by Husqy in ALL servers you share with Husqy;
4. `Disallow data collection in all servers`: To disallow data collection by Husqy in ALL servers you share with Husqy;

When selecting an option to disallow data collection, a follow-up question will be asked confirming to change the settings!

## Limitations of disallowing data collection

Disallowing data collection can have different consquences of the services delivered to you by Husqy, but they can also have consequences to the configuration of Husqy with the server, below some examples are described (Note: these are not the only possible outcomes!):

1. The users disallowing data collection can not create Reminders;
2. The users disallowing data collection can not enter Husqy Giveaways;
3. The users disallowing data collection can not create Giveaways;
4. Disallowing or deleting your data may result in configuration changes if this data is used, f.e. in the content or title of a tag, this data will be removed and the content or name may be changed;

When your data collection settings have been changed, this will not be transferred to new servers you join. In new servers, Husqy will by default be allowed to collect your data!

## Viewing server members data collection settings

A server administrator can login to the [Privacy Dashboard](#additional-information), this will show them an overview of which users have allowed and disallowed Husqy from collecting their data. Server administators CAN NOT change the data collection status of other members apart from their own data collection status!

:::tip

Other server members DO NOT have the ability to view the data collection status of other server members!
