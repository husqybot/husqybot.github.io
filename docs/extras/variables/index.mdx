Husqy variables can be used in different parts, modules and functions of Husqy and can be set during the configuration. Husqy variables follow a specific pattern in order to be used, which is the name of the variable encapsulated in `<` and `>` (so `<variable_name>`, f.e. `<user_id>`). Currently not all modules and functions support these variables, if you however use these variables in one of the unsupported modules or functions, the functionality will not break, the variable will just simply not be replaces with the actual value. If you are encountering modules or functions which do not support these variables but you wish they would, please contact our support!

Husqy has different variables available for you to use, check below for quick links or use the next page buttons!

:::tip

Husqy variables can change, if variables change, are removed or are added this will of course be added to the changelog!
