## Components

The welcoming module consists of different component, each of these component has its own goal and features. Each component can be enabled and disabled seperatly from each other making sure the module fits your exact needs. The component settings can be directly changed in the [Welcoming dashboard](#additional-info--commands), just change the configuration and press the `Save` button in the unsaved changes banner at the bottom of the screen.

### Welcome messages in DM

The `Welcome messages in DM` component enables you to send a message to a users DM when they join your server. This component makes use of responses (more in this later) with the type: `DM welcome message`. You can randomize responses if you have multiple responses with this type.

## Responses

Responses are the primary interaction for three of the welcoming module components: `Welcome messages in DM`, `Welcome messages in channel` and `Leave messages in channel`. The responses are all grouped together and are separated by type. The following types are currently available:

1. **DM welcome message**: For responses targeted for the `Welcome messages in DM` component;
2. **Channel welcome message**: For responses targeted for the `Welcome messages in channel` component;
3. **Channel leave message**: For responses targeted for the `Leave messages` component;

These responses can be an Husqy JSON embed config (when the response should be an embed) or they can be a normal message. When the responses for a component are not randomized, a response must be selected to use for sending.
