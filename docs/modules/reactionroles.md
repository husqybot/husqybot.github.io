A reactionrole is a type of message reaction which, when added by a user, assigns the linked role to a user. This allows for extra self service and a way to personalize the experience your server members have in your server, without gettings blasted with information they don't need or want. Husqy Reactionroles module provides you with the ability to create these reactionroles in your server and offload some of that administrator work.

:::tip

Use the Husqy embed utility to create an embed message for your reactionroles.

:::warning

- Husqy needs an existing message to be used for these reactionroles.
- Husqy does not support the use of custom emoji's.
