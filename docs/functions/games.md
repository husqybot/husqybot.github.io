## Heads or tails (single player)

Playing heads or tails is very simple, just run the command `/games heads_or_tails` and you are done! Husqy will prompt you with the outcome of the toss!

## Rock, Paper, Scissors (2 player)

To play Rock, Paper, Scissors, run the command `/games rock_paper_scissors` and select your opponent. You will get prompted to pick, after which your opponent gets to pick. This will go on until there is a winner or someone stops playing (by not choosing in time).

## Higher/Lower (single player)

To play Higher/Lower, run the command `/games higher_lower`. You will get prompted with a hint number. You have to select if you think the secret number is higher, equal to or lower than the hint number.
