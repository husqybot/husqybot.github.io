The Husqy Giveaways function is an easy built-in way to provide your server members with the ability to easily organize giveaways in your server. It allows members to enter and leave the giveaway and keeps track of the members who want a change to win. When the giveaway is ended, one or multiple winners will be picked. This will all be visible in the channel where the giveaway is created. Husqy also provides the giveaway owner the option to reroll a giveaway.
