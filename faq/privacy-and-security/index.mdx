## Does Husqy encrypt my data?

Husqy encrypts most of the data it uses to provide you with all functionality and at the same time ensure you data's safety. Furthermore, we use only secure endpoints (https) for our services such as the dashboard or the API. If you are doubting the safety and security of our service, please let us know.

:::warning

Because most data is encrypted, some functionality may be slower than you are maybe used to!

:::note

- Although most data is encrypted, not all data may be encrypted. Don't worry, non encrypted data is not related to users.
- We make sure we are using a safe encryption mechanism for data encryption, we won't go into detail on how this works to ensure that your data stays safe.
