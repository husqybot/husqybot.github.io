Questions related to Husqy audio playback.

## Does Husqy support playing YouTube?

No, unfortunately Husqy does not allow YouTube playback, due to limitions by YouTube and the sanctions they have put out to other bots. We do support radio stations so you can still listen to you favorite music without the need of YouTube!

## I inserted a radio station but something goes wrong, what is happening?

Our `/play radio` command utilizes something called Autocomplete, this allows us to autocomplete the selection of a given parameter based on the input you give it. The `/play radio` command is VERY dependend on this, so if you begin typing, make sure you select one of the options we provide to you with autocomplete! This way we know what radio stations you want to play and what link we have to use (thanks to TuneIn)!

So, in short, only typing the name of the radio station will not work, you MUST use autocomplete! Still having issues, please open a ticket in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZgsUhSEr43)!
