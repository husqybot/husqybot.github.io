Questions regarding Husqy permissions.

## Did the permissions for Husqy change for new invites?

Yes, the permissions for Husqy have changed for new invites. This is a needed change because some functionality required more permissions to function properly, 
like the tempchannels module for example.

## I am worried about the amount of permissions Husqy has in my server, what now?

There is no need to worry, Husqy only uses the permissions to provide you with Husqy functionality and will NEVER abuse the permission it has. 
If you do however feel the need to discuss this, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/W8EdsMkZRm) and open a ticket or, 
if that is not an option email us at info@husqy.xyz. We would like to help!

## Can I limit Husqy's permissions?

Yes, you are in full control over the permissions you give Husqy. But beware, sufficient permissions are needed for Husqy to provide you with its full
functionality, so limiting permissions may cause Husqy functions and modules to stop working.

## Some feature is not working, can it be because Husqy is missing permissions?

Yes, permissions can always be a limiting factory for Husqy delivering functionality. To make sure Husqy has the right permissions you can edit the default Husqy role 
permissions yourself or reinvite the bot of course (this may require you to reconfigure Husqy from scratch so be careful).

Also, make sure the Husqy role is at the top of the role list so Husqy is allowed to manage all roles!
