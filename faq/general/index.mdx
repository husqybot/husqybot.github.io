## I am not getting any DM's from Husqy even though I am expecting to, what now?

First of all, don’t worry, Husqy will not DM you for any ad’s, promotion or other unnecessary stuff. Husqy will only DM from Husqy functions, for example, when recieving a warning or when reminding you.

Second, if you are expecting to have gotten an Dm from Husqy, for example by using a reminder, it is possible you have not set allowed DM messages from a server where Husqy is in. To do this, please follow the following steps:

1. Right click the servers icon or the servers title (one of the servers you share with Husqy);
2. Click **_Privacy Settings_**;
3. In the **_Privacy Settings_** dialog, make sure the box **_Direct Messages_** is checked;
4. On the bottom left, access your user settings by clicking the **_cog_** icon;
5. Click **_Privacy & Safety_**;
6. Make sure **_Allow direct messages from server member_** is checked;
7. On the same screen, make sure **_Enable message requests from server members you may not know_** is also checked;
